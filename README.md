# Belly Button Biodiversity
Deployed App: https://bellybuttondash.herokuapp.com/

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet(http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).



Used Flask to design an API for the dataset and to serve the HTML &  JavaScript required for your dashboard page.
Also used a sqlite database file and SQLAlchemy inside of the Flask app code to read the data and to output the data as JSON.

Used Plotly.js to build interactive charts to dipslay data on a Bootstrap-based dashboard.
